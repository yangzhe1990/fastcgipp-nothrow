fastcgipp-nothrow
=================

fastcgipp fork that the manager's handler doesn't throw after the mainloop is running unless critical error happens. It also compiles under c++11.

The original code is bullshit in a lot of aspects. I strongly discourage anyone to use this library on any serious project before I fully examine and fix it.
