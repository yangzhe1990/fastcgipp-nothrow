fastcgipp-nothrow
=================

fastcgipp fork that the manager's handler doesn't throw after the mainloop is running unless critical error happens. It also compiles under c++11.

The original code is bullshit in a lot of aspects. I strongly discourage anyone to use this library on any serious project before anyone fully examine and fix it.

The code here serves as a support for some old application. Although the code here will not crash your application as easy as the original fastcgipp, it still contain bugs. Do not use this library for your application.
